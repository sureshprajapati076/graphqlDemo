This project includes UI version of graphql (Check GraphQLBookController file for UI)
http://localhost:9090/graphiql  => in browser
example query:

{
  allBooks {
    id
    title
    author
  }
  findById(id: 2) {
    id
    title
  }
}





And it also includes REST Exposure on top of graphql using GraphQLService.... (See BookController file)

For this service, we need to implement DataFetcher interface....


How to test:

for RestControler, first http://localhost:9090/loadall dummy data in h2.
and you can use http://localhost:9090/rungraph in postman with data as query string (See postMan-query.png)

{
  allBooks {
    id
    title
    author
  }
  findById(id: 2) {
    id
    title
  }
}
